# Envi for Vision Pro 🌍

Envi is an innovative open-source application designed for Vision Pro users, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to generate immersive environments. By utilizing the Replicate API, Envi enables users to bring their digital worlds to life with unparalleled ease and flexibility.

## Features 🚀

- **AI-Powered Environment Generation**: Create stunning, realistic environments with the assistance of advanced AI algorithms.
- **User-Controlled API Integration**: By incorporating your Replicate API token, you maintain full control over the application's operations and associated costs.
- **Open-Source Flexibility**: Dive into the code, customize features, and tailor the application to fit your unique needs.

## Installation 🛠️

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and execute the following command to clone the Envi repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/envi.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Xcode**

   Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and open the project file (`Envi.xcodeproj`) in Xcode.

2. **Build and Run the Application**

   Use Xcode to build and run the application on your Vision Pro device or an emulator. Ensure all dependencies are correctly configured within Xcode before launching.

## Usage Example 📖

Envi offers two main menus for creating environments:

- **Examples Menu**: Browse through a selection of pre-defined real-world environments to get inspired or to quickly demonstrate the capabilities of Envi.

- **Creation Menu**: This is where your creativity comes into play. After saving your Replicate API token in the application's settings, navigate to this menu to specify the type of environment you wish to generate. Simply enter a description of your desired environment, and let Envi do the rest.

Remember, your Replicate API token is essential for this process, as it allows you to manage the operational aspects and costs associated with generating environments.
